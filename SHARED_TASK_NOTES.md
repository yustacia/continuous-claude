# Shared Task Notes

## Current Goal
Improve sentences in README.md (one per iteration)

## This Iteration
- Improved line 15: The SHARED_TASK_NOTES.md coordination sentence
- Before: "A `SHARED_TASK_NOTES.md` file coordinates work across iterations between humans and AI"
- After: "A `SHARED_TASK_NOTES.md` file acts as a relay baton, passing context and next steps between iterations"
- Key change: Used "relay baton" metaphor to make the handoff nature more vivid and concrete

## Next Iteration
Pick another sentence in README.md to improve. Consider:
- Examples section (lines 44-54): Comment descriptions could be more specific about what each example demonstrates
- Lines 34-39: Flag descriptions could include more context about when/why to use each option
- Line 3: Description could be more specific about the automation benefits
